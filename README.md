# This program uses Madison public transit API data to display departure times of buses from a set station-- in this case, the buses that stop at the stations closest to my apartment.

## This application is then deployed on a Raspberry Pi and displayed on an RGB display which I hang in my apartment. 

Implemented with Libcurl.
